# Introduction to 3D Graphics Workshop
For those attending Monday workshop, and who are keen to participate in the
live code sections, there are a few things you need to setup beforehand.
P.S I will do a quick run through of setup on the night as well.

All code will be in C (don't worry it won't be as hard as CAB202).

We will be using a 3rd party library called raylib: https://www.raylib.com/
Here are the raylib installation instructions for each major platform:
Linux: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux
MacOS: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-macOS
Windows: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-Windows

Clone the workshop repo: https://github.com/justinac0/3DGraphicsWorkshopCN
Run either: `compile.sh` or `compile.bat` to compile all code.
Open any of the executables inside the `bin/` directory.
You should see a window open up.
